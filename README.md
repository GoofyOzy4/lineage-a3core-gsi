## **‚≠ê ‚Ä¢ Features**

- **Optimized** specifically for the Samsung A03 Core.
- **Removed unnecessary stuff** that don‚Äôt provide benefits for the Samsung A03 Core.
- Hidden Treble settings for a cleaner **full-ROM feel**.  
  To access them, use the following command in a superuser terminal:
    ```
    su -c "pm enable me.phh.treble.app/.TopLevelSettingsActivity"
    ```
- Offline charging now redirects to system reboot.

---

## **‚õî ‚Ä¢ Bugs**

- **No VoLTE support.**
- No offline charging (now a feature due to redirection to system reboot instead of being stuck at the Samsung logo).
